# My First README.md
One of the main things I learned in the first week was some things a person can do with HTML using simple symbols surrounding words or placing symbols before words. 

For example, if you use two asterisks at the beginning of a word and at the end of the word it will present the word in **bold** text.
If only one asterisk is used on either side it creates *italics*.

# Or the sizes of headers
## making them smaller by adding an extra pound symbol.
